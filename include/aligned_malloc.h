/**
* @brief Allocated aligned memory
*
* Allocate memory with at least alignment `align` and size `size`
* 	Memory which has been allocated with aligned_malloc() must be freed by calling
*	aligned_free(). Calling free() will result in a panic or other negative effects.
*
* @param align Alignment of the memory block.
*	Alignment refers to the starting address of the memory block.
*	If 32-byte alignment is requested, the start address of the returned pointer
*	will be 32-byte aligned.
*	Note: Alignment must be a power of two. (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.)
*
* @param size Size of the memory allocation
*
* @return Pointer to allocated memory. If memory was not successfully allocated,
*	the function will return NULL. This can happen due to invalid input
*	(alignment is 0, size is 0, alignment is not a power of 2) or due to insufficient
*	memory left for the requested allocation.
